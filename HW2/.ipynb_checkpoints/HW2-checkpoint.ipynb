    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will be using data from the Progresa program, a government social assistance program in Mexico. This program, as well as the details of its impact, are described in the paper \"School subsidies for the poor: evaluating the Mexican Progresa poverty program\", by Paul Shultz. Please familiarize yourself with the PROGRESA program before beginning this problem set, so you have a rough sense of where the data come from and how they were generated. If you just proceed into the problem set without understanding Progresa or the data, it will be very difficult!\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this problem set is to make you familiar with the simple\n",
    "estimators that you are learning in class (cross-sectional and before-after), and to use those to measure the impact of Progresa on secondary school enrollment rates.\n",
    "Your task is to estimate the impact of progresa subsidies on the school attendance.  Note: this means to estimate the causal effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background - About the PROGRESA program\n",
    "In 1990s, Mexican government decided to improve the school attendance\n",
    "of poor rural children by introducing a cash subsidy to families.\n",
    "However, the families were only able to claim the money if a) they\n",
    "were considered poor, and b) if their\n",
    "children attended school.  Most importantly in the current\n",
    "context, the subsidy was introduced in a randomized manner where\n",
    "initially only certain villages were eligible for subsidies.  In this\n",
    "problem set we analyze this time period where the subsidies\n",
    "formed essentially a randomized\n",
    "control trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The timeline of the program was:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Baseline survey conducted in 1997\n",
    "* Intervention--subsidies for _poor households_ in _treatment villages_ begins in 1998, wave 1 data was collected in 1998\n",
    "* wave 2 data collected in 1999\n",
    "* Evaluation ends in 2000, at which point all villages becomes eligible to the subsidy\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that:\n",
    "* the Progresa program was only available for poor families, so in the analysis below we only consider poor households\n",
    "* The central variable here is _sc_, the dummy variable that tells if the child did attend the school or not\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are ready, download the progresa-sample.csv data from Canvas. The dataset is from actual data collected to evaluate the impact of the Progresa program. In this file, each row corresponds to an observation taken for a given child for a given year. There are two years of data (1997 and 1998), and just under 40,000 children who are\n",
